They are presented to demonstrate the "nuts and bolts" functions of various computer-related applications. These sessions target a variety of audiences from UCF faculty and students to the general public.  These are hands-on, in-depth sessions held in the Center for Distributed Learning offices or the Faculty Multimedia Center. Seating is limited so you must RSVP if interested.</p>
