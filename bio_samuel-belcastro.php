                     <h2>Biography:</h2>

                    <p>I was 100% sure I wanted to be a Chemical Engineer until I was introduced to computer programming my junior year of high school. I am currently a UCF student majoring in Computer Science, and I am gaining outside of classroom experience in sales engineering/business transactions.</p>
                    <p>Prior to this job I have held a couple different position in the technology field. I was a volunteer at the Tarpon Springs Public Library, giving private lessons on topics ranging from how to use Windows to how to build a website. I also was an Easy Tech sales associate for Staples. Working at Staples I learned how to help other people with my knowledge.</p>
                    <p>Outside of school and work, I enjoy going to the gym, running, playing guitar, and socializing with friends. </p>
