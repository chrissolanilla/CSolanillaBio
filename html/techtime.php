                <h1>What is Tech Time?</h1>
                <p>Tech Time events are presented by the Techranger team of the <a href="#">Center for Distributed Learning</a>. They are presented to demonstrate the "nuts and bolts" functions of various computer-related applications. These sessions target intermediate to advanced web designers interested in furthering their web design skills. These are hands-on, in-depth sessions held in the Center for Distributed Learning offices for Students, Faculty, Staff, and Campus Webmasters. Seating is limited so you must RSVP if interested.</p>
                <p><a href="#">Contact us</a> if you are interested at having the Techrangers present for your on-campus event or class.  Stay tuned for future events!</p>
