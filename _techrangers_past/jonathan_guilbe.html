<p>I am a Computer Science major with a minor in Information Technology. I was born and raised in Orlando, FL.</p>
<p>I've been working with computers my whole life, and fell in love with programming after learning Python in the 9th grade. The internet fascinates me, and it is my goal to work on all kinds of web development when I graduate. </p>
<p>Outside ofschool, I enjoy video games, anime, and listening to all sorts of music. </p>
