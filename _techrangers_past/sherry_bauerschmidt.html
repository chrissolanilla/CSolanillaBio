<h2>Biography:</h2>
<p>I'm a Digital Media graduate at UCF. I've been designing web pages since I was ten, and hope to continue to do so long into the future. I'm optimistic, full of smiles, and almost always in a good mood. I enjoy playing DDR, watching action/comedy movies, attending NHL games, and rollerblading.</p>
