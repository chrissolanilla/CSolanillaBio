<p>I am double majoring in Computer Science and Biology at the University of Central Florida.  I started coding with Java in high school, and loved it so much that I decided to learn other languages in my free time!  I've written a couple of Android applications, and I love building technology to make people's lives easier</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, hiking, kayaking, and camping.</p>
