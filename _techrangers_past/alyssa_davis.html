I went to UCF for Computer Science, with a minor in Business. I found my passion of programming and technology in my high school AP Computer Science course. I learned a lot and enjoyed my time in the Techrangers immensely and I would recommend the experience to everyone. In my free time, I play videos games and take too many pictures of my cats, Felix and Smudge.
