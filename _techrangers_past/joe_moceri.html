<h2>Biography:</h2>
  <p>I am a student at the University of Central Florida studying Digital Media - Game Design. Technology is my passion, and it extends farther out than just design for video games and the web. I have close ties to my family, and I've worked on cars in all sorts of ways both with them and guided by them; Things such as audio systems, engine work, exhaust etc. I've spent a great deal of time working with them in a family business environment and have adopted a mentality of even though I don't know how to do something, I am confident in my ability to get it done. I believe the only way to improve in any area is as simple as spending time with it; Therefore, my focus is set on design and development with various technologies.</p>
