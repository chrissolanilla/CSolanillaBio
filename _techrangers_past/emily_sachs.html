<h2>Biography:</h2>
<p>I'm a senior at UCF graduating in May of 2017 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.I've worked as a Techranger since November of 2014 gaining invaluable experience in web development and web application development. <a href="https://topkit.org/">TOPkit.org</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ucfopen/UDOIT">UDOIT</a> are among the latest projects I've contributed to. I've had the opportunity to build apps for iOS and Android in my courses and do freelance work on custom websites in my spare time.</p>
<p>I'm passionate about creating things that have a positive impact on our daily lives and I'm not afraid to learn something completely new to accomplish that. I also enjoy traveling, live music, and creative writing. I aim to pursue a career that allows me to see as much of the world as possible along the way.</p>
