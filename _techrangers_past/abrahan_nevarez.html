<p>I'm currently a senior majoring in Information Technology. When I was younger, I would hack pokemon roms to make my own little games,
  this would eventually spark an interest in programming and software development as a whole. When I'm not doing software, I can be found
  composing music or writing music on my guitar and bass.
