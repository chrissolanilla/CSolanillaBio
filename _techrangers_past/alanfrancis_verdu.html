<p>I am currently a junior majoring in Computer Science at UCF. My first experience coding was in my senior year of high school,
    and I enjoyed it so much that I ended up deciding to pursue Computer Science as my major. When I'm not working or studying,
    I enjoy playing video games, cycling, and reading a good book.</p>
