<p>
    I'm currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science at UCF, having graduated from undergrad in May 2020 with degrees in 
    both Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science. I didn't start programming until my senior year of high school when I 
    took AP Computer Science, and I loved it right away. This led me to pick up a CS minor early in my college career, which I 
    eventually decided to turn into a second major.

    In my free time I enjoy playing video games, rock climbing, listening to podcasts, and attempting to learn how to play piano.
