<p>I'm a senior at the University of Central Florida, studying Computer Science. When I was a kid, it fascinated me that you could click one button and the pc understood what it meant and what to do. I thought it was really cool that you could learn to tell it what to do so I wanted to study programming ever since and here I am. </p>
<p>In my free time I like playing video games, reading and learning new things.</p>
