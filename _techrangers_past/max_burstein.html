<h2>Biography:</h2>
<p>My name is Max Burstein and I'm a graduate from UCF. I began using computers around the age of 5 and since then have been really interested in their inner workings. I love building large, scalable applications and have lately been working with Python/Django a lot. Planning to do some work with Node JS in the future as I feel the platform has a lot to offer for realtime web development.</p>
