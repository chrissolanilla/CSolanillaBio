<p>I started at UCF in 2004 as a part-time developer on the New Media team, using Flash and PHP to make educational games and other interactive elements for online courses.  After a 4-year stint in the private sector creating virtual training scenarios for the US Military, I returned to UCF to lead the Techrangers Team in creating web applications, educational systems, and LMS integrations.  I transitioned to the Scrum Master position in January 2022, where I managed the project portfolio and intake for LS&amp;T, while continuing to lead the Techrangers Team. I remained in that role until March 2024 when I moved to Cidi Labs to become their Director of LTI Development, where I will continue working on U<b>DO</b>IT and their other software offerings.</p>
