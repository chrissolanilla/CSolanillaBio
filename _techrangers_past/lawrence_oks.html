<p>Hey, I'm LJ! I was born and raised in West Palm Beach, Florida, where I went to Suncoast High School and gained interest in programming, graphic design, and game development.</p>
<p>I graduated from UCF in 2022 and worked as a techranger from my very first semester of freshman year all the way until my last day, and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.</p>
<p>I worked on multiple projects, including Soul Patch, Materia, its H5P Integration, student tools, and other LTI Integrations.</p>
<p>When i'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm usually playing soccer, board games, or an instrument!</p>
