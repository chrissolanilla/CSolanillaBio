<p>I am currently majoring in Computer Science at UCF with a focus on Software Engineering & Cybersecurity.
    I initially got interested in coding during my junior year of high school and eventually picked up
    knowledge in multiple languages since then. My hobbies include playing video games such as NBA2K
    & Madden NFL.</p>
