<h2>Biography:</h2>
<p>I am a UCF undergrad working towards a Computer Science degree. I love both designing and coding as they equally offer intriguing challenges and creative outlets. I began making websites as a hobby in middle school and have continued to hone my skills throughout the years with freelance work and personal projects. After I graduate, I plan to live in Japan for a while.</p>
