<p>I am a Computer Science student at UCF. I started programming in Python when I was 14, and switched to C in college. I started learning HTML and CSS during the beginning of my sophomore year, and found that I enjoyed web development.</p>

<p>In my free time I like to read, knit, play disc golf, and play video games.</p>
