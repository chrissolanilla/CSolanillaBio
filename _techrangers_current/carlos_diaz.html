<p>My name is Carlos A. Diaz, one of the newest full time Techrangers here at UCF. I received my degree in Molecular Biology & Microbiology from UCF, but decided to continue with my career in software development.</p>
<p>My hobbies include reading, movies, history, music, board games, and I am a member of the Society of Creative Anachronism, a medieval recreation group.</p>
