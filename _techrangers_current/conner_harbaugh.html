<!-- Description/Bio Paragrah of Employee -->
<p>As an Eagle Scout I am looking to help make an impact in the world. Since middle school I have dived into computers with my schoolâ€™s cybersecurity club. This hobby turned into a passion which lead me gain experience on a wide range of digital technologies. Overtime I found that I really do enjoy solving complex problems via code whether that be for web development, game design, or real world applications. Majoring in computer science has helped me pursue this dream and working as a Techranger helps give me real industry experience in the field. Some other interests of mine include chess, caving, hiking, and reading a good book to keep learning new things. </p>
