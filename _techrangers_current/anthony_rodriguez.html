<p>I'm currently a Computer Science major in my first semester at UCF. I plan on pursuing a minor in Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>I just recently moved to Orlando from Fort Myers. I've always been interested in some sort of computer science/code related job, but it wasn't until recently that I realized that I would like to further pursue web development.</p>
<p>I've only been with the Techrangers for a couple weeks so far but I love the environment and the people here. </p>
