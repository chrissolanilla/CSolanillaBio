<p> Hi, I'm Chris and I'm a computer engineering student  at UCF with a passion in programming and software development. </p>
<p> In my free time I often like to work on projects that include game development with the web apps as well as within unreal engine.
  When I'm not programming I'm probably at the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu club at UCF, at the gym in the UCF RWC, or at the arcade playing DDR and PIU.
</p>

<p>My goal in life is to create a successful corperation called Kawaii Kulture which will focus around creating a community in the anime and video game niche where I will create my own social media platforms, host gaming tournaments, and sell merchandise to eventually take over the world </p>
