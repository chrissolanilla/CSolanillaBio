  Hi! I'm passionate about data privacy, digital freedom, and organizing data
  into useful information. I love building automation tools, decentralized
  applications, and making contributions to anything that empowers everyone to
  get more done. <br />
  While I mainly specialize in full stack application development, I also enjoy
  exploring the intricacies of computer architecture, computer networks, and
  operating systems. When I'm tired of talking about computers all day, I like
  to play video games and play with my cats.
