<p>Hello, I'm Emanuel Cortes, born in Puerto Rico. I decided to move over here for educational purposes and ended up staying. I completed my bachelor's in Computer Engineering with a focus on hardware, but through some crazy life twists, I found a path that led me here, and I'm grateful for it. I started as a Techranger, and as time went by, I became a full-timer. In my free time, I'm either playing video games or at the gym.</p>
