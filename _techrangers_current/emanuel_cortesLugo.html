<p>I am currently a UCF student majoring in Computer Engineering. Initially, I used to be an Architecture student until a friend showed me that I could play my favorite classic games on a PC. That instance started a chain of events that lead me down the path I am traversing todayâ€”a path of yearning for more knowledge about the computer world.</p>
