<p>I got a Bachelor's degree in Music Education and worked as a music, math, and science teacher
    at a small private school for several years. In addition to teaching, I worked as a private tutor,
    music teacher, and freelance programmer to make ends meet. Eventually, I went back to school to
    get a Master's degree in computer science.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to stay in education, and got a job at the BYU Center for Teaching and Learning.
    Initially hired as a part-time student employee, I was soon hired as the Academic Technology
    Designer and Developer. My job there included everything from determining needs by meeting with
    faculty, to writing specification, to designing solutions, to developing, deploying, and maintaining
    software, to training faculty or students in its use. My favorite part of the job was working with
    and mentoring amazing student employees and being able to provide new and interesting experiences
    for them.</p>
