<p>I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at UCF. I learned how to code in middle school and haven't looked back since! We can live in a world where all software and web applications can be beautiful, clean, and accessible for all and I strive to contribute to that future. In my free time, I enjoy listening or watching anything creative - music, art, podcasts - as well as baking brownies and organizing my notes.</p>
