<p>Hi, I am a Junior studying Computer Science at UCF with a History Minor.
  Learning from the past will help us in the future. I got into programming
  because of my love of puzzles. I am interesting in learning and
  filling in the gaps in my understanding. I have a particular interest in
  cryptography, but overall anything new in the computer world excites me.</p>
