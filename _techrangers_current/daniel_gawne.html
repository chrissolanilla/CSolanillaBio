<p>
  Hello, I'm Daniel Gawne. I have a Bachelors in Philosophy from UCF and
  continued my education as a self-taught full&nbsp;stack developer after
  graduation. I have also worked as a human-in-the-loop rater, training AI
  models at top global technology companies.
</p>
<p>
  In my free time I enjoy rock climbing, bicycling, trail running, music, and
  traveling.
