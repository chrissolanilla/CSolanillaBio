<p>
    I'm a student at the University of Central Florida currently studying Computer Science.
    When I first started college, I intended on studying Music Performance, but decided to
    take the leap over to Computer Science when I saw what you could build with code.
    In my free time, I enjoy programming and practicing piano.
