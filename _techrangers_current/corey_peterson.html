<p>I was born and raised in Miami, Florida and took to art and visual design at a young age. It led to a passion, and then a profession in conjunction with web development.</p>

<p>I attended UCF's Digital Media program for my bachelor's degree and merged it with Computer Science to become a junior full-stack developer. Along the way, I was given the internship opportunity of a lifetime at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA.</p>

<p>At JPL, I worked for the Mars Program Office, assisting with logistical and mission planning software for Mars missions. I learned how to design visualizations for complicated data and working on large-scale software systems.</p>

<p>Upon graduating UCF, my career kept me closer to home: I started working for my alma mater at the Center for Distributed Learning, joining a talented team dedicated to improving online learning at UCF and across Florida.</p>

<p>My team, New Media, joined with Techrangers&reg; in 2016 under one umbrella: Learning Systems &amp; Technology. Nowadays, my focus is on managing and improving Materia&trade;, exploring augmented reality and virtual reality technologies and their potential application in digital learning.</p>
