<p>Hey, I'm Matt Emond! I was born in California but moved around a lot growing up. I ultimately ended up going to high school in Coral Springs, Florida. I later graduated from UCF with a bachelors in Information Technology. My primary focus is web development in Python with Django.</p>
<p>I originally started at CDL as a Techranger in 2012. As a Techranger, I worked on several projects, the most notable being the Dredbeard suite of internal tools, Quiz Extensions LTI integration, and CanvasAPI Python library. In 2016 I joined full-time as a member of the Integrations Team where I worked on ProctorHub, Faculty Tools, Due Date Changer, UCF Here, and other LTI integrations with Canvas.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I lead development of the Soul Patch suite of internal tools.</p>
