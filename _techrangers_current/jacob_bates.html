<p>I've been a web developer for the past 18 years, starting as a part-timer on the New Media team at CDL using Flash and PHP to make educational games and other interactive elements for online courses.  After a stint in the private sector creating virtual training scenarios for the US Military, I returned to UCF to lead the Techrangers Team in creating web applications, educational systems, and LMS integrations.  I transitioned to the Scrum Master position in January 2022.  My current duties include managing the project portfolio for LS&amp;T, continuing to manage the Techrangers Team, and coaching LS&amp;T on implementation of Agile practices and the Scrum framework.</p>
