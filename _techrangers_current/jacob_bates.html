<p>I've been a web developer for the past 13 years.  I began as a part-timer on the New Media team at CDL using Flash and PHP to make educational games and other interactive elements for online courses.  After a stint in the private sector creating virtual training scenarios for the US Military, I returned to UCF to lead the Techrangers Team in creating web applications, educational systems, and LMS integrations.</p>
