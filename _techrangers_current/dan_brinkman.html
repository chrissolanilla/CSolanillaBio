<h2>Biography:</h2>
  <p>I was born in West Palm Beach right here in Florida. My first experience on the computer was playing educational games on it at a very young age, I then moved on to different programs installed on it after I had gotten bored with the games. One of the programs I started using was Macromedia Dreamweaver. I had no idea what I was doing at the time but I could switch from Design to Code and see what made things happened, I found HTML incredibly interesting at the time.</p>
    <p>My first programming class was course in Pascal in the 8<sup>th</sup> grade and I've tried to take every programming class I had the opportunity to from then. I attended Valencia for two years and then transferred here to UCF. My goal is to graduate from UCF with a degree in Computer Science and from there get a job programming interesting applications.</p>
