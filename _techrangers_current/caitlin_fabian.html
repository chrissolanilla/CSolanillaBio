<p>Hello! I am Caitlin, a Junior at the University of Central Florida. I am currently studying Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. Originally, I wanted to become Veterinarian and study biology, but I quickly decided that's not what I am passionate about. Computer Science challenges me
  through the coursework, team-building, and copious amounts of critical thinking. I fell in love with it after taking one coding class and continue to learn every day.
  When I am not sitting in front of a computer or doing school work, I am at the gym, crocheting, or riding/modding out my Kawasaki Ninja 400.
