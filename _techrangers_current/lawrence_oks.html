<p>I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida. I started working with the Techrangers in October of 2017.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in West Palm Beach, Florida, where I went to Suncoast High School and gained interest in programming, graphic design, and game development.</p>
<p>I'm now pursuing my passion through a Computer Science degree at the University of Central Florida.</p>
<p>I'm currently apart of my first team as a developer for the Techrangers, a team that does web/application development for UCF.</p>
<p>When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm usually playing soccer, classic video games, or skateboarding.</p>
