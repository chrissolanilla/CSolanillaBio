<p>Hey I'm Daniel Molares, but you can call me Danny! I studied Computer Science at UCF and received my bachelor's in December of 2021. I started working at the Center for Distributed Learning on Spring 2022, with a focus on web development programming languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
  <p>When I'm not at work, I like to spend my time watching movies with friends or playing videogames!</p>
