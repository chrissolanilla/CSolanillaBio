<p>Hi, I'm a developer/designer currently attending UCF pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I've used a variety of languages and technologies and am currently striving to learn blockchain-related and machine-learning-related technologies. I also have an interest in graphic design and hope to create beautiful, usable, and useful applications/software systems.</p>
