  Hi, I'm Colby! I'm a Computer Science major at UCF pursuing my second degree. Towards the end of my first degree in
  Marine Biology I took a programming course and fell in love with it. After graduating I decided that I wanted to
  pursue a career in software development and enrolled at UCF.
</p>
<p>
  In my free time I enjoy working out, fishing, gaming, and hanging out with my dogs.
