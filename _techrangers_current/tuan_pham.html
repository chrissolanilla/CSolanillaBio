<p>I am a Computer Science at UCF. I started learning web development when I still was in high school. The chance to work with web technologies allows me to determine my mind for software developer as a career afterward. Besides coding, I spend much time for building and customizing LEGO. I do have a special love for LEGO that helps me relax and refreshes my mind after coding hours. I also like music espcially electronic dance music(EDM) like Tropical House, Deep House, Future Bass, and could make a EDM track.</p>
