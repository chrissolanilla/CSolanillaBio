<p>I'm a computer science student at UCF. I've been interested in game
  development for many years, and I'd like to pursue a career in gamedev
  or simulation.</p>
<p>My hobbies include gaming, hiking, gardening and art. I know a good bit
  about plants and animals and can talk at length about them. I also have a cat
  named Puzzles.</p>
