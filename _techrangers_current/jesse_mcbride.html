<h2>Biography:</h2>
  <p>Born to a family of educators and on the cusp of the information age, it's not very surprising that I found myself working in the eLearning space. I guess I could say my career in educational technology started when I was in elementary school helping to set up PowerPoint presentations for my teachers. Around the same time, thanks to my (maybe too-early) exposure to internet subculture, I became interested in programming. By the time I started college, it was obvious that I would pursue a career in software development.</p>

  <p>It took me a while to find a rhythm. I liked my programming classes and did well in them, but I never really thought of myself as a developer. I wasn't building anything substantial and I wasn't plugged into the programming community. That all changed when I joined the Techrangers team in early 2015. To prepare for my interview, I uploaded a zip archive of a project to GitHub. Within two weeks of my start date, I was learning Git Flow, working with bash, Vagrant, and a bunch of other cool tools. The Techrangers team (and LS&amp;T proper) invited me into real-world software development and I fell in love.</p>

  <p>Fast forward three years later: I have a Bachelor's in Information Technology from UCF, maintain the most widely used <a href="https://github.com/ucfopen/canvasapi">Python library for the Canvas LMS API</a>, and work full-time as the Assistant Lead for the Techrangers team. You can usually find me building internal applications with Django or configuring deployment pipelines, but I'm also passionate about mentoring new developers and pushing them in the right direction for their careers.</p>

  <p>Outside of work, I'm interested in home automation, mindfulness, and emotional intelligence. I'm a big Lord of the Rings nerd, I've been going through a pho phase for the last four years, and I listen to a lot of pop-punk and post-hardcore.</p>
