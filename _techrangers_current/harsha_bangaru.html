<p>Hi, I'm Harsha! I am currently a UCF student doing my 2nd degree in IT. Near the end of my previous degree, which was in Aerospace Engineering, I discovered a love for programming. So, after having completed that degree, I started a new one, with the hopes of paving an entirely different and exciting career path.</p>
