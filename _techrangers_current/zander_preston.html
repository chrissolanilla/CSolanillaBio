<p>Hello! I am a third year Computer Science student at UCF. My enjoyment for computer science evolved from my previous
    status as a Computational Physics student, whereas my enjoyment for theoretical math and programming were inversely related. 
    I enjoy collecting various strategy board games and hosting world building tabletop sessions with my friends. Outside of programming 
    and hosting, I tend to eat painfully spicy foods and watch silly horror films.
