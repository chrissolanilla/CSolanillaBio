                    <p>
					I've moved around a few times in my life, but Florida is and always will be my home. I entered UCF in 2011 with plans of fulfilling a lifelong goal of becoming a veterinarian. After two and a half years and several failed chemistry grades, however, I realized that Biomedical Sciences was not the major for me. So I did a 180 into Game Design. I'll always love and care for animals, but I've never been happier than I am now immersed in the world of programming. 
                    </p>

					Over the past few semesters, I've gotten my feet wet in several different languages and applications - Photoshop, Flash, C, Java, Javascript, etc. - but there's still a lot more that I can learn about each one. I'm glad and lucky to have joined the Techrangers so I can continue to sharpen my skills in these fields in addition to learning new ones I've never dealt with before, such as PHP and Python. I can't wait to see where the next few years here and in Game Design take me!
