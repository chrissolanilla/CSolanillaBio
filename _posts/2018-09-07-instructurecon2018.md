InstructureCarn, aka InstructureCon 2018, was an intense week of presentations, networking, product demos, and carnival rides.  It's difficult to cover so much in a blog post like this, so I'll try to keep it brief.

* [Dr. Chuck](https://www.dr-chuck.com/) showed off his [Tsugi](https://www.tsugi.org/) framework for quickly creating LTI-compliant applications in PHP.
* [Harvard showed off their LTI tool suite](https://www.canvaslms.com/instructurecon/video/2018/?video=pmltco9ck6), including distributed grading done fairly, swipe-in seating and attendance, and facilitating student collaboration.  All of this is done while storing as much of the data as possible in Canvas itself to reduce dependence on the custom applications in the future.
* [Jared Stein](https://www.canvaslms.com/instructurecon/video/2018/?video=r7bklv4nsf) talked about
  * a prisoner education program that uses the open source version of Canvas on a secure, offline box
  * how Red Lake Nation College uses what they call "Intrusive Advising" to ensure that students are doing their work and know what to do next.
  * new Canvas X tools like On-track Predictor, Nudge, and Developer Key Scoping
  * how [Badgr](https://badgr.com/) is now free for every Canvas installation
* [Jawahar Madineni](/techrangers_current/jawahar_madineni.html) presented [Scaling Data Science at UCF:  Using Data from Canvas](https://www.canvaslms.com/instructurecon/video/2018/?video=ejqzflretf)
* Instructure showed off [Analytics 2](https://www.canvaslms.com/instructurecon/video/2018/?video=6xqp7kjd06) and how it can help teachers visualize how well their students are doing.
* [Jacob Collins from Northwestern University](https://www.canvaslms.com/instructurecon/video/2018/?video=9q36x87ozt) talked about how he created a suite of LTI-compliant applications using Vue.js and AWS Lambda.
* Instructure announced some [new Canvas API endpoints and features](https://www.canvaslms.com/instructurecon/video/2018/?video=mun6emoc1u), including GraphQL.
* Instructure announced a new [list view for the dashboard](https://www.canvaslms.com/instructurecon/video/2018/?video=qrm9n5vujb) in Canvas.
* A team of people from Instructure talked about their [internal Hack Week](https://www.canvaslms.com/instructurecon/video/2018/?video=mykkal3sdw) and some of the cool projects that have come out of it.
* Mitch Benson showed off some [beta features](https://www.canvaslms.com/instructurecon/video/2018/?video=ywyl838bgb), including granular permissions, student feedback view, advanced reports, and the ability to use emoji instead of scores in the gradebook.
* [Karen Tinsley-Kim](https://cdl.ucf.edu/about/teams/idev/#karen) and [Jacob Bates](/techrangers_current/jacob_bates.html) teamed up with [Michelle Tuten](https://www.clemson.edu/online/staff/tuten.html) from Clemson University to cover how the [Universal Design Online content Inspection Tool](https://cdl.ucf.edu/udoit) (or UDOIT) was developed with the help of multiple institutions and members of the Canvas Community.
