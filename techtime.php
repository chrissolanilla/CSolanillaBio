					<h1>What is Tech Time?</h1>
					<p>Tech Time events are presented by the Techrangers team of the <a href="http://cdl.ucf.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Distributed Learning</a>. They are presented to demonstrate the "nuts and bolts" functions of various computer-related applications. These sessions target intermediate to advanced web designers interested in furthering their web design skills. These are hands-on, in-depth sessions held in the Center for Distributed Learning offices for Students, Faculty, Staff, and Campus Webmasters. Seating is limited so you must RSVP if interested.</p>
