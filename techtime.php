                <p>Tech Time events are presented by the Techranger team of the <a href="http://cdl.ucf.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Distributed Learning</a>. They are presented to demonstrate the "nuts and bolts" functions of various computer-related applications. These sessions target intermediate to advanced web designers interested in furthering their web design skills. These are hands-on, in-depth sessions held in the Center for Distributed Learning offices for Students, Faculty, Staff, and Campus Webmasters. Seating is limited so you must RSVP if interested.</p>

                        <p>The University of Central Florida's new learning management system, Canvas, has brought many changes to teaching and learning. While the new system is generally more accessible than its predecessor, it can present some challenges for users of screen reader software such as JAWS. This session, presented by CDL's own usability guru Munawar Bijani, will provide techniques and resources to optimize the teaching and learning experience with JAWS and Canvas.</p>
                        <p>This session is recommended for all students, faculty, and staff that use or provide support to users of JAWS with Canvas.</p>
